# odin-recipes
The Odin Project 1

This is my first Project from the Odin Project. The goal is to build a basic recipe website
The website consists of main index page which will have links to a few recipes
Set up a Repository on GitHub called odin-recipes
move the repository onto the local machine with the "git clone" command
Remember to use git to save/backup stuff often
